# PLUGIN: WooCommerce Background Shipping

Revised and optimised background shipping module for WooCommerce. Allows background processing of shipping info for orders using Action Scheduler.

Requires WooCommerce Shipment Tracking plugin to be installed.

**NOTE:** this is a bespoke plugin created for a client, so will likely need modding to work for your use case.
